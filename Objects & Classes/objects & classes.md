**Classes** and **Objects** are two different terms and should not be used interchangeably, they can sometimes seem like they both refer to the same thing but 
each has a different meaning.

Class is like blueprint which defines what an object should look like. We can design object by creating **classes**.
Object is the actual intity created from a class.

Here's a comparison that illustrates when to use which:

In summary, **objects** are to **Classes** what **variables** are to **Data types**.

## Strings

You've probably already noticed that (unlike all primitive types) Strings start with an upper case 'S'! That's because a String is in fact a class and not a primitive type

A String variable is made up of an array of characters `(char [])` as its field, but being an object means that it also offers some powerful methods like `length()` that counts and returns the number of characters in that array, and `equals(String s)` that compares the characters in this string with another string.

## Everything is an object in Java

Because Java is an OOP language, it includes classes that simply wrap around all the primitive types themselves to offer some extra functionality through their methods:

Each of those classes is made up of the corresponding primitive type as its field, but usually also comes with some powerful methods.

It also allows you to forget about primitive types and treat everything in Java as an object. However, it is still recommended to use primitive types when writing a simple piece of code.
