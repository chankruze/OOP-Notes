An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods. The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.\

It only defines what needs to be done but not how to do it.Interfaces lists the methods that need to be included in the class but no implementation codes.
